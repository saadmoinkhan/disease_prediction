# Disease Prediction
System to implement a predictive model in healthcare systems which will dynimacally run every time a record of the patient is updated.

The new values of the patient will then go in to the model and then it will predict whether they have the chance of heart disease or not.

This model can be implemeented to any other health issue with a few tweaks.
